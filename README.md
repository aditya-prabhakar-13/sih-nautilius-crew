# Ocean Insights Platform

## Overview
Our platform transforms complex oceanographic data into accessible and actionable insights for both technical and non-technical users. By combining AI-powered query interpretation with high-performance visualizations, we enable users to explore, analyze, and understand ocean data efficiently.

---
### 1. AI Query Engine
We leverage the **LangChain** open-source framework, originally developed by MIT students, with a unique twist: integration of the **RASA** conversational tool as a suggestion model.  
- Interprets user intent and suggests clarifications for ambiguous queries.  
- Example: A query for "temperature trends" may be clarified as a request for a "seasonal anomaly comparison".  
- Ensures accurate and relevant insights, even for non-technical users.

### 2. Highly Interactive Interface
- **Visualization:** Built with **Recharts**, enabling dynamic, responsive, and customizable graphs.  
- **Performance:** **TanStack Query** in **React.js** manages background fetching, caching, and updates efficiently.  
- Provides smooth, near real-time interactions even with large datasets.

### 3. Flexibility for All User Types
- Automatically selects the best visualization tool for different data types:
  - Maps for float trajectories
  - Line charts for anomalies
  - Comparison plots for parameter analysis  
- Users can also switch views, adjust scales, or change axes for personalized exploration.  
- Intuitive for beginners, powerful for expert analysts.

## Future Roadmap
- Fully integrate **ARGO datasets** for comprehensive ocean data coverage.  
- Introduce a dedicated **AI Chatbot tab** for domain-specific query resolution.  
- Build a **Data Explorer** that allows filtering, exploration, and export of curated datasets (e.g., CSV) for downstream workflows.

## Tech Stack
- **AI & NLP:** LangChain + RASA  
- **Frontend:** React.js, Recharts, TanStack Query  
- **Data Handling:** Curated datasets with flexible visualization options  
- **Future Enhancements:** AI Chatbot, Data Explorer

## Summary
Our differentiation comes from combining **AI-powered prompt refinement**, **high-performance visualization**, and **flexible data management**. The platform is designed to be **fast, interactive, and scalable**, evolving with the needs of both technical and non-technical users.
